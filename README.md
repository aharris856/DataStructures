# DataStructures
Just a fun repository of some of my own implementation of some data structures
none of these have a main method, to access them you'll have to main a tester file
and run some tests this way. The tester file in this tests all of the structures at once
so if you dont want to have all of these structures in one file this tester file will not compile.
If you want to test an individual one you can make your own tester file and read through each section
in the tester file to see how some commands are used!
